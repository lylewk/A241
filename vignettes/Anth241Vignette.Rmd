The code below is all you need for Homework "0".  It is called Homework
"0" because it is really just a test to make sure that you have
installed R/Rstudio and that you know your way around.
There are two "problems" that you can run.  You can do either
one, or both if you want.  For the first one, you will produce
two plots, both of which you should copy to the *.doc or *.docx
file that you will submit
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Copy the line below that does not have a # sign, paste to console 
# and "enter" or "return", paste and copy plot to your *.doc or *.docx
# file, and ...
Fig3_1()
# Do the same for the line below
Fig3_1(1,3)
```
